# Waterfall.glyphsPlugin

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It is a window that shows the current font in different sizes.
After installation, it will add the menu item *Window > Waterfall*.
You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.
Massive thanks to [Mark2Mark](https://github.com/Mark2Mark) for the help!
